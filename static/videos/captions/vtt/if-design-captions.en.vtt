00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.360 line:0 align:middle
At If there is one thing that stands
above everything else.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.680 line:0 align:middle
One thing that drives us.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.920 line:0 align:middle
Truly being there for our customers.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.120 line:0 align:middle
That means putting our heart into our
customers lives.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.400 line:0 align:middle
Their relationships,

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.600 line:0 align:middle
their connections, the things they value

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.160 line:0 align:middle
and their peace of mind.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.880 line:0 align:middle
So we've created a visual identity

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.200 line:0 align:middle
that peels away the unnecessary,

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.920 line:0 align:middle
that reduces complexity,

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.360 line:0 align:middle
making complex matters, easy to understand

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.960 line:0 align:middle
and draws attention to what matters the
most

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160 line:0 align:middle
in a simply personal way.

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.880 line:0 align:middle
Beige is our warm canvas that enables

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.080 line:0 align:middle
flexibility and structure to our offer.

16
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.440 line:0 align:middle
The blue plays a prominent role

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.960 line:0 align:middle
as our sender id, blue gives us the

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.360 line:0 align:middle
universal benefit of signaling attention

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.960 line:0 align:middle
into action and activation.

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.960 line:0 align:middle
A number of supporting colors are used to
clarify

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.720 line:0 align:middle
our statistics and numbers,

22
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.880 line:0 align:middle
our images focus on what's most
important,

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.080 line:0 align:middle
both in composition and by using depth
of field.

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.000 line:0 align:middle
Our typography is inspired by handwriting

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.080 line:0 align:middle
If Sans is an airy and clean typeface.

26
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.680 line:0 align:middle
It has the ability to mimic acts of care
and

27
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.480 line:0 align:middle
support, like the way it can connect

28
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.560 line:0 align:middle
its closest character.

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.520 line:0 align:middle
At its core we have a visual identity

30
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.760 line:0 align:middle
designed to bring clarity to our offer,

31
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.760 line:0 align:middle
an expression that is stunning in its
simplicity

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.160 line:0 align:middle
while radiating emotion.

33
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.720 line:0 align:middle
A visual identity that emphasizes

34
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.880 line:0 align:middle
the very heart and soul of our brand.

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.920 line:0 align:middle
Truly being there, simple, personal.
